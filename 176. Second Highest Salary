Key thing is to return a NULL value in case of no second highest salary 

  Using max() function: Selecting max salary from the tables after removing the max salary.

SELECT 
    MAX(salary) as SecondHighestSalary
FROM Employee 
WHERE salary!= (SELECT max(salary) FROM Employee); # or use <

  Using LIMIT and OFFSET: 

SELECT 
IFNULL(
(SELECT
   DISTINCT salary 
FROM Employee 
ORDER BY salary DESC
LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1),null) as secondHighestSalary;

  Using ranks :

SELECT 
    max(salary) as secondhighestsalary
FROM
(SELECT 
    salary, 
    dense_rank() OVER(ORDER BY salary desc) as r
FROM Employee
) x
WHERE x.r=2;
