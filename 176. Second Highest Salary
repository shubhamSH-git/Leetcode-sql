Key thing is to return a NULL value in case of no second highest salary 

  Using max() function: Selecting max salary from the tables after removing the max salary.

SELECT 
    MAX(salary) as SecondHighestSalary
FROM Employee 
WHERE salary!= (SELECT max(salary) FROM Employee);

  Using LIMIT and OFFSET: 

SELECT 
IFNULL(
(SELECT
   DISTINCT salary 
FROM Employee 
LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1),null) as secondHighestSalary;
