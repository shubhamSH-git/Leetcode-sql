1. Using windows rank function:
SELECT
    score,
    dense_rank() over(ORDER BY score desc ) as 'rank'
FROM Scores;


2. Using INNER JOIN:
SELECT 
    s1.score,
    count(distinct s2.score)  as 'rank'
FROM Scores s1
INNER JOIN Scores s2
ON s1.score<=s2.score
GROUP BY s1.id,s1.score
ORDER BY score desc;

3. Using subquery:

SELECT 
    s1.score,
    (SELECT count(DISTINCT s2.score) FROM Scores s2 WHERE s1.score<=s2.score) as 'rank'
FROM Scores s1
ORDER BY score desc;
